# Info
This is for my personal webpage. The url now is [http://gepcel.github.io/]().

# Structure:
There are 2 branches, `blog` for the source content and configs of the webpage, and `master` for the status pages generated by pelican built automatically by travis.

`.travis.yml` is the config for ti.

For a new computer, set up python and pelican, clone the `blog` branch, edit and push it.

`git clone git@github.com:gepcel/gepcel.github.io.git --branch blog --single-branch`

ok, this line is a test.
